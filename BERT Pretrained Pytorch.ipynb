This is because the problem of controlling and centering increases rapidly as the size of the lump becomes heavier. Long, tedious attempts to master a big piece only lead to frustration, disappointment, and material which soon becomes too wet to manage anyway. In my opinion, a smaller wheel and less powerful motor is quite sufficient for most students and for many serious workers too.'],\n",

Even so, pots on the top shelf can easily be far cooler than those placed lower down in the kiln, If one superimposes on this additional discrepancy the ones we have just examined, it is easy to visualise that within the same firing chamber quite startling variations in temperature can occur.'],\n",

If a colour is inadvertantly smudged the damage can aften be repaired; use a razor blade to scratch away the smear and then very carefully fill in again with the paint brush. Where a slipped surface is chipped or otherwise marked the piece at this stage will be too dry to correct with slip, and one can either try and make good straightaway with the nearest available pottery colour or wait until after the biscuit firing and use colour before dipping the piece in glaze.'],\n",

This is to avoid splitting the chamber into separate compartments. It is far better to allow the pots to overhang the edges a little and so permit the heat to circulate freely.
